        story of Molly, a young mohawk girl. After surviving a terrifying

            Quote 1 : "And my dad, who I used to think was big and strong and
            smart enough to defeat any moster in the world, had been
            helpless."(69, Bruchac)

            <p>
              This quote stood out to me because it showed how although your
              parents, especially your father, may appear to be strong and
              indestructible, they are just humans with weaknesses at the end of
              the day.

            Quote 2 : ,"No. Everything is fine. Just fine" (67, Bruchac)
            <p>
              Holly, who is the person that says this quote, is put in an
              extremely detreimental situation but cannot accept her fate and
              reality so she tries her best to look on the brighter side. Many
              people try to look on brighter side of thier miseries but a big
              part of trying to be optimistic is to accept your situation.

            Quote 3 : "In the stark gleam of the headlights i can see the tall,
            thin figure astride that ATV, his head a glistening skull, his eyes
            red as blood" ( 126, Bruchac)

            <p>
              This quote demostrated great imagery that really described how
              Holly felt in that moment.

    <p id="para">
      I would not recommend The return of the Skeleton Man by Joseph Bruchac
      primarily due to its slow pacing and underwhelming suspense. While the
      story has potential, the tension never fully builds, making it less
      engaging for readers who expect a thrilling mystery. In addition , the
      character lacks depth, and the plot feels predictable which detracts from
      the overall experience. For those seeking a gripping, fast-paced story,
      this book might feel disappointing and fail to hold attention.
